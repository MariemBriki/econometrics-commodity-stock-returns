# 📈 Econometric Analysis of Commodity Influence on Stock Indices (2024)

This project explores how commodity returns — specifically Gold and Oil — affect the behavior of major U.S. stock indices: the S&P 500 and NASDAQ during 2024.  
Through rigorous econometric modeling, we quantify and interpret the dynamic relationships between global commodities and financial markets in a year marked by high volatility.
